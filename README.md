## 👋 About the author

My name is Bobby Iliev, and I have been working as a Linux DevOps Engineer since 2014. I am an avid Linux lover and supporter of the open-source movement philosophy. I am always doing that which I cannot do in order that I may learn how to do it, and I believe in sharing knowledge.

I think it's essential always to keep professional and surround yourself with good people, work hard, and be nice to everyone. You have to perform at a consistently higher level than others. That's the mark of a true professional.

For more information, please visit my blog at [https://bobbyiliev.com](https://bobbyiliev.com), follow me on Twitter [@bobbyiliev_](https://twitter.com/bobbyiliev_) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQWmdHTeAO0UvaNqve9udRw).
